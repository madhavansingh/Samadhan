# Samadhan – Civic Issue Reporting Platform  

Samadhan is a platform that helps citizens **report, track, and resolve local issues** in their community.  
From potholes and sanitation problems to broken streetlights, Samadhan makes it simple for people to raise concerns and ensures they reach the right authorities.

## ✨ Why Samadhan?  

Every city faces problems that affect everyday life. Often, these issues remain unresolved because there isn’t a clear way for citizens to escalate them.  
Samadhan was created to bridge that gap by giving people a voice and creating a direct, transparent channel with local governance.
